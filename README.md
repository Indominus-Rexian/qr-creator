# qr-creator
A QR CODE Creator made with Python and Flask

Create your own QR CODE Creator with very basic Python and Flask

## How to Run
----
First install the latest source code from the releases pane and then extract it.

Then in the folder you have stored the source code, open the cmd/terminal with admin rights(In linux, you can run it by starting commands with `sudo`).

Run the command- `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies.

Then run the `app.py` with admin permissions(not doing so will lead to Error 13 in Flask).

After you get something in the terminal as this, it will mean you can now go to your localhost with port 5000 and path `/qrcreate` or [just click here](http://localhost:5000/qrcreate)-
```
* Serving Flask app 'app' (lazy loading)

```

And Voila!! You can know convert any text or link to a QR Code.

(PS:Don't mind my HTML, I am very bad at.)
